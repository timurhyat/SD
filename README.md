Sustainable Development
The conditions prevailing in Pakistan are not sustainable, resulting in growing environmental degradation; increased poverty; malnourishment; unemployment and migration to Cities.  There is a great need to correct this situation in order to ensure Environment Protection; Food Security; Local Self-Reliance and Prosperity.  Integrated Development that addresses ALL major issues that face the bewildered masses is a pressing issue that will go a long way in correcting this situation.  By taking the position of converting adversity into opportunity, an all-out effort can be made to live in harmony with Nature, using Biological interventions through the creation of vibrant, dynamic and locally self-sufficient Communities.  The objectives of the Program will be achieved when the community’s skills and talents are tapped in such a manner that they declare “We Did It.”  To overcome these problems there is a pressing need for ACROSS THE BOARD INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT in place of Band-Aid Development (Defined as focus on one out of many prerequisites for Sustainable Development).
